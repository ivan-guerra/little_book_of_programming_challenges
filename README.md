# Little Book of Programming Challenges

This repo contains Rust solutions to the coding challenges provided in [The
Little Book of Programming Challenges][1].

To run any single solution, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin c<N>
```

where `<N>` is the number of the challenge you want to run. Likewise, you can
run all unit tests via `cargo test` or execute a single challenge's unit tests
via `cargo test --bin c<N>`.
